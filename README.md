Conception Connection!
======================

Implementation [here](http://mxadelman.herokuapp.com "Check it out.")

Based off of this [SMBC Comic](http://www.smbc-comics.com/index.php?db=comics&id=2922#comic "It's awesome!"), Conception Connection is a chance for me to learn a bit about rails, and the use of Twitter/Bootstrap.

TODO:
More accurate conception dating...266 days isn't that accurate.  
Add an option for people to put in if they were premature.  
Add an option if people know their own conception date.  
More varied results.
